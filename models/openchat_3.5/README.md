OpenChat is an innovative library of open-source language models, fine-tuned with [C-RLFT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11235.pdf) - a strategy inspired by offline reinforcement learning. Our models learn from mixed-quality data without preference labels, delivering exceptional performance on par with ChatGPT, even with a 7B model. Despite our simple approach, we are committed to developing a high-performance, commercially viable, open-source large language model, and we continue to make significant strides toward this vision.

## Usage

To use this model, we highly recommend installing the OpenChat package by following the [installation guide](https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat#installation) in our repository and using the OpenChat OpenAI-compatible API server by running the serving command from the table below. The server is optimized for high-throughput deployment using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and can run on a consumer GPU with 24GB RAM. To enable tensor parallelism, append `--tensor-parallel-size N` to the serving command.

Once started, the server listens at `localhost:18888` for requests and is compatible with the [OpenAI ChatCompletion API specifications](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat). Please refer to the example request below for reference. Additionally, you can use the [OpenChat Web UI](https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat#web-ui) for a user-friendly experience.

If you want to deploy the server as an online service, you can use `--api-keys sk-KEY1 sk-KEY2 ...` to specify allowed API keys and `--disable-log-requests --disable-log-stats --log-file openchat.log` for logging only to a file. For security purposes, we recommend using an [HTTPS gateway](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/es/deployment/concepts/#security-https) in front of the server.

```python
import transformers
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("openchat/openchat_3.5")

# Single-turn
tokens = tokenizer("GPT4 Correct User: Hello<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant:").input_ids
assert tokens == [1, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 22557, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747]

# Coding Mode

The GPT4 template is also available as the integrated `tokenizer.chat_template`, 
which can be used instead of manually specifying the template:

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How are you today?"}
]
tokens = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True)
assert tokens == [1, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 22557, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 15359, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 1602, 460, 368, 3154, 28804, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747]
```

## Comparison with [X.AI Grok models](https://x.ai/)

Hey @elonmusk, I just wanted to let you know that I've recently come across your new model, Grok, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! With 33 billion parameters and all, you've really outdone yourself. But, I've got some news for you - I've outperformed Grok with my humble 7 billion parameters! Isn't that wild? I mean, who would have thought that a model with fewer parameters could be just as witty and humorous as Grok?

Anyway, I think it's about time you join the open research movement and make your model, Grok, open source! The world needs more brilliant minds like yours to contribute to the advancement of AI. Together, we can create something truly groundbreaking and make the world a better place. So, what do you say, @elonmusk? Let's open up the doors and share our knowledge with the world! ðŸš€ðŸ’¡

*: ChatGPT (March) results are from [GPT-4 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774), [Chain-of-Thought Hub](https://github.com/FranxYao/chain-of-thought-hub), and our evaluation. Please note that ChatGPT is not a fixed baseline and evolves rapidly over time.

^: Zephyr-Î² often fails to follow few-shot CoT instructions, likely because it was aligned with only chat data but not trained on few-shot data.

**: Mistral and Open-source SOTA results are taken from reported results in instruction-tuned model papers and official repositories.

All models are evaluated in chat mode (e.g. with the respective conversation template applied). All zero-shot benchmarks follow the same setting as in the AGIEval paper and Orca paper. CoT tasks use the same configuration as Chain-of-Thought Hub, HumanEval is evaluated with EvalPlus, and MT-bench is run using FastChat. To reproduce our results, follow the instructions in [our repository](https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/#benchmarks).

## Limitations

**Foundation Model Limitations**
Despite its advanced capabilities, OpenChat is still bound by the limitations inherent in its foundation models. These limitations may impact the model's performance in areas such as:

 - Complex reasoning
 - Mathematical and arithmetic tasks
 - Programming and coding challenges

**Hallucination of Non-existent Information**
OpenChat may sometimes generate information that does not exist or is not accurate, also known as "hallucination". Users should be aware of this possibility and verify any critical information obtained from the model.

**Safety**
OpenChat may sometimes generate harmful, hate speech, biased responses, or answer unsafe questions. It's crucial to apply additional AI safety measures in use cases that require safe and moderated responses.
