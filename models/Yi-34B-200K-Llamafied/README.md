While benchmarking open-source models, we have observed a disparity between the
results generated by our pipeline and those reported in public sources (e.g.
OpenCompass). Upon conducting a more in-depth investigation of this difference,
we have discovered that various models may employ different prompts,
post-processing strategies, and sampling techniques, potentially resulting in
significant variations in the outcomes. Our prompt and post-processing strategy
remains consistent with the original benchmark, and greedy decoding is employed
during evaluation without any post-processing for the generated content. For
scores that were not reported by the original authors (including scores reported
with different settings), we try to get results with our pipeline.

To evaluate the model's capability extensively, we adopted the methodology
outlined in Llama2. Specifically, we included PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande,
ARC, OBQA, and CSQA to assess common sense reasoning. SquAD, QuAC, and BoolQ
were incorporated to evaluate reading comprehension. CSQA was exclusively tested
using a 7-shot setup, while all other tests were conducted with a 0-shot
configuration. Additionally, we introduced GSM8K (8-shot@1), MATH (4-shot@1),
HumanEval (0-shot@1), and MBPP (3-shot@1) under the category "Math & Code". Due
to technical constraints, we did not test Falcon-180 on QuAC and OBQA; the score
is derived by averaging the scores on the remaining tasks. Since the scores for
these two tasks are generally lower than the average, we believe that
Falcon-180B's performance was not underestimated.

## Usage

Please visit our [github repository](https://github.com/01-ai/Yi) for general
guidance on how to use this model.

## Disclaimer

Although we use data compliance checking algorithms during the training process
to ensure the compliance of the trained model to the best of our ability, due to
the complexity of the data and the diversity of language model usage scenarios,
we cannot guarantee that the model will generate correct and reasonable output
in all scenarios. Please be aware that there is still a risk of the model
producing problematic outputs. We will not be responsible for any risks and
issues resulting from misuse, misguidance, illegal usage, and related
misinformation, as well as any associated data security concerns.
