Dynamic Factor is a general capability upgrade to Llama 2 13b, using primarily open source data to improve overall knowledge, precise communication, conceptual understanding, and technical skill. (Primary training set is a sub-selection of [UltraFeedback](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ultrafeedback_binarized) cleaned further and converted to Llama 2 prompt style.)

Training data has been supplemented with some general capabilities data from the Shining Valiant training dataset; effect on personality or language style is minimal.

This model is primarily recommended as a superior-to-Llama-2 baseline for additional finetuning, not for direct deployment to production as a chat model. The user accepts full responsibility for all outputs.
