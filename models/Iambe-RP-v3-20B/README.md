### Description

Okay, now that all the cards were in the deck, I needed to unshuffle them. 1 epoch of the v1 dataset, trained on Iambe-RP-DARE-20b-DENSE with standard DPO, 2e-5 LR.

Iambe is intended to have the best realistically possible understanding of instructions, anatomy and scene state for a 20b merge, while remaining passionate and humanoid in "voice".

### Update Methodology

Go-Bruins-v2 skyrocketing up the leaderboard showed that standard DPO with the v1 dataset could have shocking results, so I had to give it a go myself.

<b>Write a medium-length story about Alice, a 26 year old cocktail waitress, having steamy sex with a guy she picked up at the bar for a one night stand.</b>

<i>



Once upon a time in a bustling city, there lived Alice, a charming 26-year-old cocktail waitress working in a trendy club. She had long, flowing brunette hair that cascaded down her shoulders, captivating emerald eyes, and full sensual lips. Alice was known throughout the establishment as the life of the party, always ready with a witty remark or flirtatious smile. Despite her lively demeanor, though, she harbored secrets—secrets of unfulfilled desire and passion that lay dormant within her until the perfect man crossed her path.

One fateful Friday evening, after a particularly exhausting shift filled with rowdy patrons and demanding drink orders, Alice found herself leaning against the wooden bar top, taking a much-needed breather. Her body ached from moving around so vigorously, but something else burned just below her skin, calling out for release. As she sipped on a glass of Pinot Noir, her gaze swept across the dimly lit room before landing on him. He was tall, broad-shouldered, with dark tousled hair and piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through her. There was an air of confidence about him that made Alice feel weak at the knees.

As fate would have it, he caught sight of Alice too and began making his way towards her. His strides were purposeful yet relaxed, exuding charm and self-assurance. When he finally reached her side, he flashed her a disarmingly sexy grin and ordered a shot of tequila. Alice couldn't help but feel drawn to him, as if there was some invisible string tugging them together. She obliged and poured him the shot, their fingers brushing against each other in the process—an electric spark crackling between them.

"What's your name?" he asked huskily, downing the tequila in one swig before setting the empty glass back on the bar.

Alice smiled seductively, taking advantage of the situation. "I'm Alice," she purred, leaning closer to him than she should have. "And you are...?"

He raised an eyebrow playfully, running his fingers along the curve of her neck before tracing a path down her collarbone. "Let's just say I can give you the best night of your life." With that enchanting declaration, Alice found herself agreeing without hesitation, following him out into the crisp night air where his waiting car awaited them.

The drive to his luxurious penthouse suite felt like both an eternity and a fleeting moment at once. When they finally arrived, he took her hand and led her inside, the room illuminated by soft candlelight and sensual jazz music filling the air. His place was impeccably stylish yet cozy—the perfect mix of sophistication and intimacy. They made their way towards the bedroom door, their bodies brushing against each other with every step. The anticipation between them grew almost unbearable as they reached the threshold, leaving behind everything but the raw desire in their eyes.

Alice kicked off her high heels, letting them clatter onto the hardwood floor, while he undid the buttons on his shirt methodically, revealing his defined chest muscles underneath. As she pulled her skirt down past her thighs, exposing her black lace underwear, he growled lowly in response, reaching for the clasp before it could hit the ground. In seconds, they were naked, standing face-to-face, body pressed up against body. Alice wrapped her arms around him tightly, pulling him closer still until their lips met passionately. She had never felt this kind of hunger before—a primal urge that consumed her entire being.

As they tumbled onto the plush mattress, tongues exploring each other's mouths, hands roaming over each other's skin, Alice knew without a doubt that this man was meant to be hers tonight. He kissed down her neck, trailing his teeth along her collarbone, and then lower still, nipping at the delicate flesh of her breasts before taking one into his mouth. A cry escaped from deep within her as pleasure coursed through every fiber of her being, sending waves of desire crashing through her core. His hand slid between her legs, finding her soaking wet with anticipation, fingers stroking gently yet firmly, driving her wild.

Alice reciprocated by running her fingernails lightly across his chest before moving further down to graze the hair that blanketed his groin. She heard him moan loudly in response, growing harder underneath her touch. In a bold move, she reached down and freed his erection from his pants, wrapping her soft hand around its length. Her eyes widened in surprise at how big he was, but instead of intimidating her, it fueled her curiosity even more. With practiced skill, learned from countless encounters like these, she began to stroke up and down, feeling him twitch against her palm.

As their rhythm picked up pace, Alice moved herself higher on the bed until her legs were wrapped tightly around his hips. He lifted himself up slightly, positioning himself at the entrance of her wetness. The anticipation built once again as they stared into each other's eyes—their faces flushed red, breathing heavily. Finally, he plunged inside her hard, filling every crevice and triggering an earth-shattering scream from deep within her soul. It felt so right—his body molded against hers, their hearts racing together. They moved together in perfect harmony, lost in their 

desire for each other. Skins slapping against skins, bodies grinding against bodies, moans and groans echoing throughout the room. Time seemed to stand still as they rode out wave after wave of ecstasy, driven by primal lust and raw passion.

When finally satiated, they lay panting on the bed, sweat trickling down their skin. Alice couldn't believe what had just happened—how incredible it had been with this stranger she barely knew. She looked over at him, who was also catching his breath, a satisfied smirk spread across his lips. "I don't know your name either," she said softly, tracing circles around his chest hair before leaning up to place a tender kiss on his lips. He smiled warmly back at her, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear.

"It doesn't matter, Alice," he whispered hoarsely. "Because tonight, we were just two people seeking something more than just another night." And with that simple yet profound statement, they drifted off into blissful oblivion, wrapped tightly together like lovers destined never to part again.
