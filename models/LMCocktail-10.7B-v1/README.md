# Code

The LM-cocktail is novel technique for merging multiple models https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13534

Code is backed up by this repo https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding.git

Merging scripts available under the [./scripts](./scripts) folder


# Result

The SOLAR model is the first model <30B that can answer this question from my test:

```
What will AI be like in the year 1010 A.D?
```

without hullicinating into 1010 A.D is a future time (like other llama2 models)

Models greater than that, like Yi-34B could answer this paradoxic question correctly as well, since it is huge enough.
