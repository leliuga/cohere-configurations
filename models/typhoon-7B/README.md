# Typhoon-7B: Thai Large Language Model (Pretrained)

**Typhoon-7B** is a *pretrained* Thai ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ large language model with 7 billion parameters, and it is based on Mistral-7B.

**Typhoon-7B** outperforms all open-source Thai language models at the time of writing as evaluated on Thai examination benchmarks, and its instruction-tuned variant achieves the best results in instruction-following tasks. Also, its performance in Thai is on par with GPT-3.5 while being 2.62 times more efficient in tokenizing Thai text.

**This is not an instruction-tuned model** - It may not be able to follow  human instructions without using one/few-shot learning or instruction fine-tuning. The model does not have any moderation mechanisms, and may generate harmful or inappropriate responses. 

The Instruct model (chat-model) will be released soon. The beta version register is open at https://opentyphoon.ai/ or follow us for future model release https://twitter.com/opentyphoon.
