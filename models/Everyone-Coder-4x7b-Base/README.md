EveryoneLLM series of models are a new Mixtral type model created using experts that were finetuned by the community, for the community. This is the first model to release in the series and it is a coding specific model. EveryoneLLM, which will be a more generalized model, will be released in the near future after more work is done to fine tune the process of merging Mistral models into a larger Mixtral models with greater success. 

The goal of the EveryoneLLM series of models is to be a replacement or an alternative to Mixtral-8x7b that is more suitable for general and specific use, as well as easier to fine tune. Since Mistralai is being secretive about the "secret sause" that makes Mixtral-Instruct such an effective fine tune of the Mixtral-base model, I've decided its time for the community to directly compete with Mistralai on our own.

The models that were used in this merger were as follow:

- https://huggingface.co/fblgit/UNA-TheBeagle-7b-v1

- https://huggingface.co/LucciAI/openchat-3.5-0106-function-calling

- https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardMath-7B-V1.1

- https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.6-mistral-7b-dpo-laser


Thank you to the creators of the above ai models, they have full credit for the EveryoneLLM series of models. Without their hard work we wouldnt be able to achieve the great success we have in the open source community. ðŸ’—

You can find the write up for this model here:
