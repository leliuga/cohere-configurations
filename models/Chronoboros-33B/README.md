This model was the result of a 50/50 average weight merge between Airoboros-33B-1.4 and Chronos-33B.

After prolonged testing we concluded that while this merge is highly flexible and capable of many different tasks, it has to much variation in how it answers to be reliable.
Because of this the model relies on some luck to get good results, and is therefore not recommended to people seeking a consistent experience, or people sensitive to anticipation based addictions.

If you would like an improved version of this model that is more stable check out my Airochronos-33B merge.
