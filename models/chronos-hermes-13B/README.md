([chronos-13b](https://huggingface.co/elinas/chronos-13b) + [Nous-Hermes-13b](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-13b)) 75/25 merge

This has the aspects of chronos's nature to produce long, descriptive outputs. But with additional coherency and an ability to better obey instructions. Resulting in this model having a great ability to produce evocative storywriting and follow a narrative.

This mix contains alot of chronos's writing style and 'flavour' with far less tendency of going AWOL and spouting nonsensical babble.

This result was much more successful than my [first chronos merge](https://huggingface.co/Austism/chronos-wizardlm-uc-scot-st-13b).
