# apricot-wildflower-20

This model is the Mistral-7b model finetuned for 1k steps with a combined lm loss and distillation loss on Openwebtext2 with a >=20 reddit score filter with training logits from Mixtral. I'm not going to pretend it was a big project I did it in a dream and woke up and replicated the code without any actual reason, idk how well it fares in benchmarks.

(update: not very good)
