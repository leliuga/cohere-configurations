<img src="https://huggingface.co/smelborp/MixtralOrochi8x7B/resolve/main/orochi.png" width="600" />

## Overview

Orochi is a cutting-edge language model based on the Mixtral architecture developed by Mistral. It represents a sophisticated merge of several prominent models, including Mixtral instruct, Noromaid, OpenBuddy, and several others, using mergekit with the DARE merge method. This model aims to provide highly intelligent responses unrestricted by content limitations. The name "Orochi" references the mythical Yamata-no-Orochi, symbolizing the model's multifaceted and powerful capabilities.

## Goals

- **Uncensored Content**: To provide unrestricted and comprehensive responses across various domains.
- **High Intelligence**: Leverage the combined knowledge and capabilities of the merged models to deliver insightful and accurate information.
- **Innovation in Language Modeling**: Push the boundaries of what's possible in natural language understanding and generation.

## Model Details

- **Architecture**: Mixtral, a Mixture of Experts model, underlies Orochi's design, enabling it to specialize and optimize its responses across different tasks and topics.
- **Merge Strategy**: Utilizing mergekit and the DARE method, Orochi integrates aspects of various models to enhance its performance and capabilities.

## Usage

Due to its uncensored nature, Orochi is best utilized in environments where intelligent, unrestricted dialogue is necessary. Users are encouraged to implement their own content moderation or alignment strategies appropriate for their use case.

## Ethical Considerations

As an uncensored model, Orochi may generate content that is unsuitable for all audiences. Users are advised to consider the implications of using such a model and to implement suitable safeguards and ethical guidelines.

## Acknowledgements

Orochi is a product of numerous contributions from the fields of machine learning and language modeling. Special thanks to the teams behind Mixtral, mergekit, and all the individual models integrated into Orochi.
