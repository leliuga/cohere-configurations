# This model is a collab between [IkariDev](https://huggingface.co/IkariDev) and [Undi](https://huggingface.co/Undi95)!

Nethena-20B model. Use Alpaca format. Suitable for RP, ERP and general stuff.

What would happen if we combine all of out best models? Well.. here it is, the holy grail: **Echidna v0.3** + **Athena v3** + **Nete**
