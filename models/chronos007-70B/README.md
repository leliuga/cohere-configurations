# chronos007-70b fp16

This is a merge of Chronos-70b-v2 and model 007 at a ratio of 0.3 using the SLERP method, with Chronos being the parent model. This is an experimental model that has improved Chronos' 
logical and reasoning abilities while keeping the unique prose and general writing Chronos provides. This is an experiment for possible future Chronos models. 

There are multiple different quantized versions that can be found below including GGUF, GPTQ, and AWQ thanks to [@TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke)

## License

This model is strictly [*non-commercial*](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) (**cc-by-nc-4.0**) use only which takes priority over the **LLAMA 2 COMMUNITY LICENSE AGREEMENT**. If you'd like to discuss using it for your business, contact Elinas through Discord **elinas**, or X (Twitter) **@officialelinas**. 

The "Model" is completely free (ie. base model, derivates, merges/mixes) to use for non-commercial purposes as long as the the included **cc-by-nc-4.0** license in any parent repository, and the non-commercial use statute remains, regardless of other models' licences. 
At the moment, only 70b models released will be under this license and the terms may change at any time (ie. a more permissive license allowing commercial use).

## Model Usage

This model uses Alpaca formatting, so for optimal model performance, use it to start the dialogue or story, and if you use a frontend like SillyTavern ENABLE Alpaca instruction mode:

```
### Instruction:
Your instruction or question here.

### Response:
```
Not using the format will make the model perform significantly worse than intended.
