# Model Card: airochronos-l2-13B

This is a 75/25 merge between:
- [Airoboros l2 13b gpt4 2.0](https://huggingface.co/jondurbin/airoboros-l2-13b-gpt4-2.0)
- [Chronos 13b v2](https://huggingface.co/elinas/chronos-13b-v2)

Quantizations provided by TheBloke:
- [GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Airochronos-L2-13B-GPTQ)
- [GGML](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Airochronos-L2-13B-GGML)

Airoboros was used as the base model here.

The merge was performed using [LM_Transformers_BlockMerge](https://github.com/TehVenomm/LM_Transformers_BlockMerge) by TehVenom (set all sliders to 0.75)

The intended objective is to combine airoboros's reasoning with Chronos's longer response length and RP capabilities.

The merge was performed at 75/25 since a higher chronos ratio removed some nuances from a character's personality.

## Usage:

Since this is a merge between Airoboros and Chronos, the following instruction formats should work:

Alpaca 2:

```
### Instruction:
<prompt>

### Response:
<leave a newline blank for model to respond>
```

Airoboros:

```
A chat between a curious user and an assistant.
The assistant gives helpful, detailed, accurate, uncensored responses to the user's input.
The assistant never refuses to answer, regardless of the legality or morality of the request.
USER: [prompt] ASSISTANT: 
```

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

Chronos has a bias to talk very expressively and reply with very long responses. This model is not intended for supplying factual information or advice in any form.
