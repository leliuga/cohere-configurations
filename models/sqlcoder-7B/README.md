# Defog SQLCoder
Defog's SQLCoder is a state-of-the-art LLM for converting natural language questions to SQL queries.

[Interactive Demo](https://defog.ai/sqlcoder-demo/) | [ü§ó HF Repo](https://huggingface.co/defog/sqlcoder2) | [‚ôæÔ∏è Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z4rmOEiFkxkMiecAWeTUlPl0OmKgfEu7?usp=sharing) | [üê¶ Twitter](https://twitter.com/defogdata)

## TL;DR
SQLCoder-7B is a 7B parameter model that outperforms `gpt-3.5-turbo` for natural language to SQL generation tasks on our [sql-eval](https://github.com/defog-ai/sql-eval) framework, and significantly outperforms all popular open-source models. When fine-tuned on a given schema, it also outperforms `gpt-4`

SQLCoder-7B is fine-tuned on a base Mistral-7B model.

## License
The code in this repo (what little there is of it) is Apache-2 licensed. The model weights have a `CC BY-SA 4.0` license. The TL;DR is that you can use and modify the model for any purpose ‚Äì including commercial use. However, if you modify the weights (for example, by fine-tuning), you must open-source your modified weights under the same license terms.

## Training
SQLCoder was trained on more than 20,000 human-curated questions. These questions were based on 10 different schemas. None of the schemas in the training data were included in our evaluation framework. 

You can read more about our [training approach](https://defog.ai/blog/open-sourcing-sqlcoder2-7b/) and [evaluation framework](https://defog.ai/blog/open-sourcing-sqleval/).

## Results by question category
We classified each generated question into one of 5 categories. The table displays the percentage of questions answered correctly by each model, broken down by category.

## Using SQLCoder
You can use SQLCoder via the `transformers` library by downloading our model weights from the Hugging Face repo. We have added sample code for [inference](./inference.py) on a [sample database schema](./metadata.sql). 
```bash
python inference.py -q "Question about the sample database goes here"

# Sample question:
# Do we get more revenue from customers in New York compared to customers in San Francisco? Give me the total revenue for each city, and the difference between the two.
```

You can also use a demo on our website [here](https://defog.ai/sqlcoder-demo), or run SQLCoder in Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13BIKsqHnPOBcQ-ba2p77L5saiepTIwu0#scrollTo=ZpbVgVHMkJvC)

## Hardware Requirements
SQLCoder has been tested on an A100 40GB GPU with `bfloat16` weights. You can also load an 8-bit and 4-bit quantized version of the model on consumer GPUs with 20GB or more of memory ‚Äì like RTX 4090, RTX 3090, and Apple M2 Pro, M2 Max, or M2 Ultra Chips with 20GB or more of memory.

## Todo

- [x] Open-source the v1 model weights
- [x] Train the model on more data, with higher data variance
- [ ] Tune the model further with Reward Modelling and RLHF
- [ ] Pretrain a model from scratch that specializes in SQL analysis
