# Stable Beluga 7B

Use [Stable Chat (Research Preview)](https://chat.stability.ai/chat) to test Stability AI's best language models for free

## Model Description

`Stable Beluga 7B` is a Llama2 7B model finetuned on an Orca style Dataset

## Usage

Start chatting with `Stable Beluga 7B` using the following code snippet:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("stabilityai/StableBeluga-7B", use_fast=False)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("stabilityai/StableBeluga-7B", torch_dtype=torch.float16, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, device_map="auto")
system_prompt = "### System:\nYou are StableBeluga, an AI that follows instructions extremely well. Help as much as you can. Remember, be safe, and don't do anything illegal.\n\n"

message = "Write me a poem please"
prompt = f"{system_prompt}### User: {message}\n\n### Assistant:\n"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
output = model.generate(**inputs, do_sample=True, top_p=0.95, top_k=0, max_new_tokens=256)

print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

Stable Beluga 7B should be used with this prompt format:
```
### System:
This is a system prompt, please behave and help the user.

### User:
Your prompt here

### Assistant:
The output of Stable Beluga 7B
```

## Model Details

* **Developed by**: [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/)

### Training Dataset

` Stable Beluga 7B` is trained on our internal Orca-style dataset

### Training Procedure

Models are learned via supervised fine-tuning on the aforementioned datasets, trained in mixed-precision (BF16), and optimized with AdamW. We outline the following hyperparameters:

| Dataset           | Batch Size | Learning Rate |Learning Rate Decay| Warm-up | Weight Decay | Betas       |
|-------------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Orca pt1 packed   | 256        | 3e-5          | Cosine to 3e-6    | 100     | 1e-6         | (0.9, 0.95) |
| Orca pt2 unpacked | 512        | 3e-5          | Cosine to 3e-6    | 100     | 1e-6         | (0.9, 0.95) |

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations

Beluga is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Beluga's potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Beluga, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.
