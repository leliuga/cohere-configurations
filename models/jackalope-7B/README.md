# Jackalope 7B

We have used the [SlimOrca dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/SlimOrca), PIPPA, and various other open datasets
to fine-tune on top of [Mistral 7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1).

This dataset is our attempt to reproduce the dataset generated for Microsoft Research's [Orca Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707).
We use [OpenChat](https://huggingface.co/openchat) packing, trained with [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl).

This release highlights the efficiency of SlimOrca, while improving the ability of the model's multi-turn chat.

HF Leaderboard evals puts this model only slightly below the MistralOrca release, but can be considered a 
reasonable tradeoff for a more general model that can handle multi-turn chat.

If you'd like to try the model now, we have it running on fast GPUs unquantized: https://huggingface.co/spaces/openaccess-ai-collective/jackalope-7b

# Quantized Models

Quantized versions of this model are generously made available by [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke).

- AWQ: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Jackalope-7B-AWQ
- GPTQ: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Jackalope-7B-GPTQ
- GGUF: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Jackalope-7B-GGUF


# Prompt Template

We used [OpenAI's Chat Markup Language (ChatML)](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/chatml.md) format, with `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` tokens added to support this.

This means that, e.g., in [oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/) the "`MPT-Chat`" instruction template should work, as it also uses ChatML.

This formatting is also available via a pre-defined [Transformers chat template](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating),
which means that lists of messages can be formatted for you with the `apply_chat_template()` method:

```python
chat = [
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are JackalopeAI, a large language model trained by OpenAccess AI Collective. Write out your reasoning step-by-step to be sure you get the right answers!"}
  {"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am doing well!"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Please tell me about the mythical creatures called jackalopes."},
]
tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
```

which will yield:

```
<|im_start|>system
You are JackalopeAI. Write out your reasoning step-by-step to be sure you get the right answers!
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
How are you?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I am doing well!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Please tell me about the mythical creatures called jackalopes.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
```

If you use `tokenize=True` and `return_tensors="pt"` instead, then you will get a tokenized
and formatted conversation ready to pass to `model.generate()`.


# Evaluation

## HuggingFace Leaderboard Performance

![All benchmarks](https://huggingface.co/openaccess-ai-collective/jackalope-7b/resolve/main/images/bench.png)


| Metric | Value |
|-----------------------|--|
| MMLU (5-shot)         | 63.63 |
| ARC (25-shot)         | 63.31 |
| HellaSwag (10-shot)   | 83.29 |
| TruthfulQA (0-shot)   | 49.99 |
| Avg.                  | 65.06 |

We use [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) to run the benchmark tests above, using the same version as the HuggingFace LLM Leaderboard.

# Dataset

We used a verified, curated, filtered selection of most of the GPT-4 augmented data from the OpenOrca dataset.
Additionally we include multi-turn chat from PIPPA, various datasets 
by LDJ from Nous Research, MetaMathQA, and Chain-of-Thought augmented data from the train split of RiddleSense.

# Training

We trained with 8x A6000 GPUs for 96 hours, completing 4 epochs of full fine tuning on our dataset in one training run.
Commodity cost was ~$650.
