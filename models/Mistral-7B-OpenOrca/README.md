# OpenOrca - Mistral - 7B - 8k

We have used our own [OpenOrca dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca) to fine-tune on top of [Mistral 7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1). 
This dataset is our attempt to reproduce the dataset generated for Microsoft Research's [Orca Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707).
We use [OpenChat](https://huggingface.co/openchat) packing, trained with [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl).

This release is trained on a curated filtered subset of most of our GPT-4 augmented data.
It is the same subset of our data as was used in our [OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B model](https://huggingface.co/Open-Orca/OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B).

**HF Leaderboard evals place this model as #1 for all models smaller than 30B at release time, outperforming all other 7B and 13B models!**

This release provides a first: a fully open model with class-breaking performance, capable of running fully accelerated on even moderate consumer GPUs.
Our thanks to the Mistral team for leading the way here. 

We affectionately codename this model: "*MistralOrca*"

If you'd like to try the model now, we have it running on fast GPUs unquantized: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Open-Orca/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca

We are in-process with training more models, so keep a look out on our org for releases coming soon with exciting partners.

We will also give sneak-peak announcements on our Discord, which you can find here:

# Quantized Models

Quantized versions of this model are generously made available by [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke).

- AWQ: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-AWQ
- GPTQ: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-GPTQ
- GGUF: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-GGUF


# Prompt Template

We used [OpenAI's Chat Markup Language (ChatML)](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/chatml.md) format, with `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` tokens added to support this.

This means that, e.g., in [oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/) the "`MPT-Chat`" instruction template should work, as it also uses ChatML.

This formatting is also available via a pre-defined [Transformers chat template](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating),
which means that lists of messages can be formatted for you with the `apply_chat_template()` method:

```python
chat = [
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are MistralOrca, a large language model trained by Alignment Lab AI. Write out your reasoning step-by-step to be sure you get the right answers!"}
  {"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am doing well!"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Please tell me about how mistral winds have attracted super-orcas."},
]
tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
```

which will yield:

```
<|im_start|>system
You are MistralOrca, a large language model trained by Alignment Lab AI. Write out your reasoning step-by-step to be sure you get the right answers!
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
How are you?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I am doing well!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Please tell me about how mistral winds have attracted super-orcas.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
```

If you use `tokenize=True` and `return_tensors="pt"` instead, then you will get a tokenized 
and formatted conversation ready to pass to `model.generate()`.


# Inference

See [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yZlLSifCGELAX5GN582kZypHCv0uJuNX?usp=sharing) for inference details.

Note that you need the development snapshot of Transformers currently, as support for Mistral hasn't been released into PyPI yet:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```


# Evaluation

## HuggingFace Leaderboard Performance

We have evaluated using the methodology and tools for the HuggingFace Leaderboard, and find that we have dramatically improved upon the base model.
We find **106%** of the base model's performance on HF Leaderboard evals, averaging **65.84**.

At release time, this beats all 7B and 13B models!

This is also **98.6%** of *`Llama2-70b-chat`*'s performance!

![HF Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/Open-Orca/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca/resolve/main/Images/MistralOrca7BHFLeaderboard.png)


| Metric | Value |
|-----------------------|-------|
| MMLU (5-shot)         | 62.24 |
| ARC (25-shot)         | 64.08 |
| HellaSwag (10-shot)   | 83.99 |
| TruthfulQA (0-shot)   | 53.05 |
| Avg.                  | 65.84 |

We use [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) to run the benchmark tests above, using the same version as the HuggingFace LLM Leaderboard.


## AGIEval Performance

We compare our results to the base Mistral-7B model (using LM Evaluation Harness).

We find **129%** of the base model's performance on AGI Eval, averaging **0.397**.
As well, we significantly improve upon the official `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` finetuning, achieving **119%** of their performance.

## BigBench-Hard Performance

We find **119%** of the base model's performance on BigBench-Hard, averaging **0.416**.

## GPT4ALL Leaderboard Performance

We gain a slight edge over our previous releases, again topping the leaderboard, averaging **72.38**.

## MT-Bench Performance

MT-Bench uses GPT-4 as a judge of model response quality, across a wide range of challenges.
We find our performance is *on-par with `Llama2-70b-chat`*, averaging **6.86**.

# Dataset

We used a curated, filtered selection of most of the GPT-4 augmented data from our OpenOrca dataset, which aims to reproduce the Orca Research Paper dataset.


# Training

We trained with 8x A6000 GPUs for 62 hours, completing 4 epochs of full fine tuning on our dataset in one training run.
Commodity cost was ~$400.
