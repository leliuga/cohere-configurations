Sunset Boulevard is a general capability upgrade to Llama 2 70b, using open source data to improve overall knowledge, precise communication, conceptual understanding, and technical skill.


Most data used is public open-source data, downloaded from HuggingFace. (Public open source data is supplemented with some data from the Shining Valiant training dataset; effect on personality and dialogue style is generally negligible.)


Similarly to Stellar Bright, this model is primarily recommended as a superior-to-Llama-2 baseline for additional finetuning, not for direct deployment to production as a chat model. The user accepts full responsibility for all outputs.
