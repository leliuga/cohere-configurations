This is a general capability upgrade to Llama-2-13B, using open source data to improve multilingual ability, overall knowledge, extended communication, and technical skill.

This model is primarily recommended as a superior-to-Llama-2 baseline for additional finetuning, not for direct deployment to production as a chat model. The user accepts full responsibility for all outputs.
