Continuation of https://huggingface.co/nkpz/llama2-22b-daydreamer-v1

Trained it a couple more epochs on airoboros v2 general data.

This resulted in improvements to its obsession with overexplaining itself - it's a little less instruction focused and feels more versatile. Still needs work overall, but I think it's moving in the right direction.

Still more to come. Going to try to find a way to improve its problem solving skills without ruining the output style.
