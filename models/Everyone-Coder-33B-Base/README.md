EveryoneLLM series of models made by the community, for the community. This is a coding specific model made using fine-tunes of deekseekcoder-33b-base.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Im having trouble benchmarking this model because I suck at running llm benchmarks, but from hand testing running the model through https://edabit.com/challenge coding challenges vs up to date gpt-4. My model is hands down beating it in coding. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ive recently noticed this model has trouble with end tokens so I made a custom prompt template for it. Made sure to add (Always end with "<|EOT|>") In addition to your system prompt and  (Always end your response with "<|EOT|>") at the end of the User message is the preset. Then add <|EOT|> as a custom stop string in your LM text generating interface. 

```
Always end with "<|EOT|>"

{System}

<|User|>

{User}. Always end your response with "<|EOT|>"

<|Assistant|>

{Assistant}
```

The models that were used in this merger were as follow:

- https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-33b-instruct

- https://huggingface.co/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-DeepSeek-33B

- https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-33B-V1.1

Thank you to the creators of the above ai models, they have full credit for the EveryoneLLM series of models. Without their hard work we wouldnt be able to achieve the great success we have in the open source community. ðŸ’—
