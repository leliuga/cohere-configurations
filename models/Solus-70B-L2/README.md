A failed checkpoint of Euryale 1.5, which I have named Solus, but I liked it enough to keep.

Merged with 1.3, then fine-tuned afterwards.

She feels pretty smart, and is verbose in her writing even if you go 'ah ah mistress', she'll give good responses to that atleast.

She is also Neutral like Euryale 1.5 in her alignment? Atleast, it felt that way during my tests. Lmk if you get different results.

She is not the best in terms of benchmarks from what I tested on, but I enjoyed her anyway.

Prompt Template: Vicuna 1.1 / Alpaca | Both Works. I tested.
