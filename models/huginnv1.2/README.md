better version of the old huginn model, I THINK it's a little tamer now? less of a schizophrenic loose cannon,


it's chronos, airoboros, hermes, beluga merged using my random-merge method, then merged with mythologic using model revolver, then merged with ledgerdemain, and the limarp lora.


I'm aware that mythologic  has some of the models huginn already had, but merging them in a second time seemed to smooth out some of it's weird behaviors, and then ledgerdemain allows it to do "step by step" thinking with character behaviors in roleplays.

It is a little less verbose, unless you take some care in the prompt, where aledgedly it's a verbose as the old one, but it's a little harder to make it be as verbose.
It benefits best from the alpaca format for instructions, but you can chat with it too.

thanks to gryphe for helping with improving this merge and permitting me to add it to the official version! It means a lot!


v1.3 will be actually trained on, I recently got access to some training servers thanks to the guanaco team!
