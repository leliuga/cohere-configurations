# OpenOrca - LlongOrca - 13B - 16k

We have used our own [OpenOrca dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca) to fine-tune on top of [LLongMA-2-13b-16k](https://huggingface.co/conceptofmind/LLongMA-2-13b-16k). 
This dataset is our attempt to reproduce the dataset generated for Microsoft Research's [Orca Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707).
We use [OpenChat](https://huggingface.co/openchat) packing, trained with [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl).

This release is trained on a curated filtered subset of most of our GPT-4 augmented data.
It is the same subset of our data as was used in our [OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B model](https://huggingface.co/Open-Orca/OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B).

HF Leaderboard evals place this model as #1 for all 13B long context models at release time.
We achieve >112% the performance of the base LLongMA2-13b-16k model we tuned on top of.
As well, we preserve >98% of the performance of the OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B model we share datasets with, while extending the context to 16k.

We did this training as part of testing setup of our H100 cluster.

Many thanks to @EnricoShippole, @theemozilla, and @kaiokendev1 for the fine work on creating the LlongMA-2-13b-16k model this was trained on top of!

We are in-process with training more models, so keep a look out on our org for releases coming soon with exciting partners.

We will also give sneak-peak announcements on our Discord, which you can find here:

# Prompt Template

We used [OpenAI's Chat Markup Language (ChatML)](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/chatml.md) format, with `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` tokens added to support this.

## Example Prompt Exchange

```
<|im_start|>system
You are LlongOrca, a large language model trained by Alignment Lab AI. Write out your reasoning step-by-step to be sure you get the right answers!
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
How are you<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I am doing well!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
How are you now?<|im_end|>
```


# Evaluation

We have evaluated using the methodology and tools for the HuggingFace Leaderboard, and find that we have significantly improved upon the base long context model.
We reach >112% of LLongMA2-13B-16k performance.

## HuggingFaceH4 Open LLM Leaderboard Performance

We have run our own tests using parameters matching the [HuggingFaceH4 Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) evals.

We preserve >98% of OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B performance and are #1 on the leaderboard for long context 13B models at release time.
We have >103% performance of the next 16k model (vicuna-13b-v1.5-16k).

As well, we expect the context extension techniques from LLongMA to be more robust than other 16k context models available.

## GPT4ALL Leaderboard Performance

We find we score higher than all non-OpenOrca models on the GPT4ALL leaderboard, while preserving ~98.7% of our OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B performance.

# Dataset

We used a curated, filtered selection of most of the GPT-4 augmented data from our OpenOrca dataset, which aims to reproduce the Orca Research Paper dataset.
Further details of our curation practices will be forthcoming with our full model releases.


# Training

We trained with 8x H100 GPUs for 10 hours, completing 4 epochs of full fine tuning on our dataset in one training run.
Commodity cost was ~$300.
