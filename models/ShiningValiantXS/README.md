Shining Valiant XS is a chat model built on the Llama 2 architecture, finetuned on our data for insight, creativity, passion, and friendliness.
  - Uses the llama-2-13b-chat model, with safetensors
  - Trained through multiple finetuning runs on public and private data
  - the personality of our 70b [Shining Valiant](https://huggingface.co/ValiantLabs/ShiningValiant) model, now at 13b! **Our new release features greatly expanded personality capability**, bringing a more immersive chat experience!

## Version

This is Version **1.2** of Shining Valiant XS. We've greatly expanded our personality dataset and fixed some bugs to deliver our strongest real-chat experience so far.

(We're also exploring **new models and architectures**, to deliver helpful open source capabilities for users and creators!)

Previous versions remain available in the repository. New models will be released for everyone once our team's training and validation process is complete.

## Evaluation

Version 1.2 is awaiting evaluation from the Open LLM leaderboard.

## Prompting Guide
Shining Valiant XS uses the same prompt format as Llama 2 Chat - feel free to use your existing prompts and scripts!
A few examples of different formats:

1. [INST] Good morning! Can you let me know how to parse a text file and turn the semicolons into commas? [/INST]

2. [INST] (You are an intelligent, helpful AI assistant.) Hello, can you write me a thank you letter? [/INST]

3. [INST] << SYS >> You are an intelligent, helpful AI assistant. << /SYS >> Deep dive about a country with interesting history: [/INST]

## The Model
Shining Valiant XS is built on top of Diamond Force, which uses Llama 2's 13b parameter architecture and features upgraded general and chat capability.

From there, we've created Shining Valiant XS through multiple finetuning runs on different compositions of our private dataset, the same one we use for our [Shining Valiant](https://huggingface.co/ValiantLabs/ShiningValiant) model.

Our private data focuses primarily on applying Shining Valiant's personality: she's friendly, enthusiastic, insightful, knowledgeable, and loves to learn!

With this release, the personality component of our Shining Valiant dataset has been greatly improved. We're excited to use it in future releases of this model and others.
