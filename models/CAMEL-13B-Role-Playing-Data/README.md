CAMEL-13B-Role-Playing-Data is a chat large language model obtained by finetuning LLaMA-13B model on a total of 229K conversations created through our role-playing framework proposed in [CAMEL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760). We evaluate our model offline using EleutherAI's language model evaluation harness used by Huggingface's Open LLM Benchmark. CAMEL-13B scores an average of 57.2.
