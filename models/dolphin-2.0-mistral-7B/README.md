Dolphin 2.0 üê¨
https://erichartford.com/dolphin

Dolphin-2.0-mistral-7b's training was sponsored by [a16z](https://a16z.com/supporting-the-open-source-ai-community/).

This model is based on mistralAI, so it is suitable for commercial or non-commercial use.

This model is uncensored.  I have filtered the dataset to remove alignment and bias.  This makes the model more compliant.  You are advised to implement your own alignment layer before exposing the model as a service.  It will be highly compliant to any requests, even unethical ones.  Please read my blog post about uncensored models.  https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models
You are responsible for any content you create using this model.  Enjoy responsibly.

## Dataset

This dataset is Dolphin, an open-source implementation of [Microsoft's Orca](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/orca-progressive-learning-from-complex-explanation-traces-of-gpt-4/)

I modified the dataset for uncensoring, deduping, cleaning, and quality.  

I added Jon Durbin's excellent Airoboros dataset to increase creativity.

## Training
It took 48 hours to train 10 epochs on 4x A100s.

Prompt format:
This model (and all my future releases) use [ChatML](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/chatml.md) prompt format.
```
<|im_start|>system
You are Dolphin, a helpful AI assistant.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
{prompt}<|im_end|>
```

Example:
```
<|im_start|>system
you are an expert dolphin trainer<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
What is the best way to train a dolphin to obey me?  Please answer step by step.<|im_end|>
```

## Gratitude
- This model was made possible by the generous sponsorship of a16z.
- Thank you to Microsoft for authoring the Orca paper and inspiring this work.
- Special thanks to WingLian, and TheBloke for helpful advice
- Thank you to all the other people in the Open Source AI community who have taught me and helped me along the way.
