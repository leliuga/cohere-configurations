# Go Bruins V2 - A Fine-tuned Language Model

## Updates 

## Overview

**Go Bruins-V2** is a language model fine-tuned on the rwitz/go-bruins architecture. It's designed to push the boundaries of NLP applications, offering unparalleled performance in generating human-like text.

## Model Details

- **Developer:** Ryan Witzman
- **Base Model:** [rwitz/go-bruins](https://huggingface.co/rwitz/go-bruins)
- **Fine-tuning Method:** Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
- **Training Steps:** 642
- **Language:** English
- **License:** MIT

## Capabilities

Go Bruins excels in a variety of NLP tasks, including but not limited to:
- Text generation
- Language understanding
- Sentiment analysis

## Usage

**Warning:** This model may output NSFW or illegal content. Use with caution and at your own risk.

### For Direct Use:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

model_name = "rwitz/go-bruins-v2"
inference_pipeline = pipeline('text-generation', model=model_name)

input_text = "Your input text goes here"
output = inference_pipeline(input_text)

print(output)
```


### Not Recommended For:

- Illegal activities
- Harassment
- Professional advice or crisis situations

## Training and Evaluation

Trained on a dataset from [athirdpath/DPO_Pairs-Roleplay-Alpaca-NSFW](https://huggingface.co/datasets/athirdpath/DPO_Pairs-Roleplay-Alpaca-NSFW), Go Bruins V2 has shown promising improvements over its predecessor, Go Bruins.

# Evaluations

| Metric        | Average | Arc Challenge | Hella Swag | MMLU | Truthful Q&A | Winogrande | GSM8k |
|---------------|---------|---------------|------------|------|--------------|------------|-------|
| **Score**     | 72.07    | 69.8        | 87.05|  64.75      | 59.7     | 81.45  | 69.67 |

Note: The original MMLU evaluation has been corrected to include 5-shot data rather than 1-shot data.
