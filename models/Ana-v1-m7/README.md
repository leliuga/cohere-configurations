Purely experimental ----- I do not know what I am doing, this is for fun. A merge + train. Final qLoRA train took 3 hours on a 4090.

*Kinda forgot, but alpaca format works fine lol

Why no 70Bs? Because the 4090 I have currently broke down. falling back to 3060 12gb.. I'm runpod training them for now.
