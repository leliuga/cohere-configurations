# TinyLlama-1.1B
</div>

https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama

The TinyLlama project aims to **pretrain** a **1.1B Llama model on 3 trillion tokens**. With some proper optimization, we can achieve this within a span of "just" 90 days using 16 A100-40G GPUs ðŸš€ðŸš€. The training has started on 2023-09-01.

We adopted exactly the same architecture and tokenizer as Llama 2. This means TinyLlama can be plugged and played in many open-source projects built upon Llama. Besides, TinyLlama is compact with only 1.1B parameters. This compactness allows it to cater to a multitude of applications demanding a restricted computation and memory footprint.

#### This Model
This is an intermediate checkpoint with 480K steps and 1007B tokens.


#### How to use
You will need the transformers>=4.31
Do check the [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama) github page for more information.
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
import transformers 
import torch
model = "PY007/TinyLlama-1.1B-intermediate-step-240k-503b"

pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto",
