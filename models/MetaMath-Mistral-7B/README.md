## Note

All MetaMathQA data are augmented from the training sets of GSM8K and MATH. 
<span style="color:red"><b>None of the augmented data is from the testing set.</b></span>

You can check the `original_question` in `meta-math/MetaMathQA`, each item is from the GSM8K or MATH train set.

## Model Details

MetaMath-Mistral-7B is fully fine-tuned on the MetaMathQA datasets and based on the powerful Mistral-7B model. It is glad to see using MetaMathQA datasets and change the base model from llama-2-7B to Mistral-7b can boost the GSM8K performance from 66.5 to **77.7**.

To fine-tune Mistral-7B, I would suggest using a smaller learning rate (usually 1/5 to 1/10 of the lr for LlaMa-2-7B) and staying other training args unchanged.
More training details and scripts can be seen at https://github.com/meta-math/MetaMath

## Installation

```
pip install transformers==4.35.0
pip install torch==2.0.1
pip install sentencepiece==0.1.99
pip install tokenizers==0.13.3
pip install accelerate==0.21.0
pip install bitsandbytes==0.40.0
pip install vllm
pip install fraction
pip install protobuf
```

## Model Usage

prompting template:

'''

"Below is an instruction that describes a task. "
"Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n"
"### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Response: Let's think step by step."

'''

where you need to use your query question to replace the {instruction} 

There is another interesting repo about Arithmo-Mistral-7B in https://huggingface.co/akjindal53244/Arithmo-Mistral-7B, where they combine our MetaMathQA dataset and MathInstruct datasets to train a powerful model. Thanks agian for their contributions.
We would also try to train the combination of **MetaMathQA** and **MathInstruct** datasets, and also open all the results and training details.
