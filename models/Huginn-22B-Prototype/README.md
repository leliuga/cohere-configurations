prototype of https://huggingface.co/upstage/llama-30b-instruct-2048 merged with huginn v3 using chargoddard's frankenllama script

model has not been finetuned but seems functional from testing so far, I plan on finetuning it later, I'm just uploading the prototype so I can distribute it to testers


still uses alpaca format, or chat
