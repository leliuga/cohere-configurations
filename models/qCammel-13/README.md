# qCammel-13
qCammel-13 is a fine-tuned version of Llama-2 13B model, trained on a distilled dataset of 15,000 instructions using QLoRA. This model is optimized for academic medical knowledge and instruction-following capabilities.

## Model Details
*Note: Use of this model is governed by the Meta license. In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the [website](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and accept their License before downloading this model .*

The fine-tuning process applied to qCammel-13 involves a distilled dataset of 15,000 instructions and is trained with QLoRA, 


**Variations** The original Llama 2 has parameter sizes of 7B, 13B, and 70B. This is the fine-tuned version of the 13B model.

**Input** Models input text only.

**Output** Models generate text only.

**Model Architecture** qCammel-13 is based on the Llama 2 architecture, an auto-regressive language model that uses a decoder only transformer architecture.
