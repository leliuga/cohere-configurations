Undi doing chemistry again.

Layer of Xwin-Mlewd was added in a different way than I do before, result seem good, but I'm a VRAMlet so I can only run the Q2 at 2k context for now.

Need to see if it really work good or I was just lucky with my prompt.

LimaRP is always kicking in and thus, this can be used to have more control on the size of the output.
