### Overview

Llama 2 70b fine tune using https://huggingface.co/datasets/jondurbin/airoboros-gpt4-1.4.1

See the previous llama 65b model card for info:

### Contribute

If you're interested in new functionality, particularly a new "instructor" type to generate a specific type of training data,
take a look at the dataset generation tool repo: https://github.com/jondurbin/airoboros and either make a PR or open an issue with details.

### Licence and usage restrictions

Base model has a custom Meta license:
- See the [meta-license/LICENSE.txt](meta-license/LICENSE.txt) file attached for the original license provided by Meta.
- See also [meta-license/USE_POLICY.md](meta-license/USE_POLICY.md) and [meta-license/Responsible-Use-Guide.pdf](meta-license/Responsible-Use-Guide.pdf), also provided by Meta.

The fine-tuning data was generated by OpenAI API calls to gpt-4, via [airoboros](https://github.com/jondurbin/airoboros)

The ToS for OpenAI API usage has a clause preventing the output from being used to train a model that __competes__ with OpenAI

- what does *compete* actually mean here?
- these small open source models will not produce output anywhere near the quality of gpt-4, or even gpt-3.5, so I can't imagine this could credibly be considered competing in the first place
- if someone else uses the dataset to do the same, they wouldn't necessarily be violating the ToS because they didn't call the API, so I don't know how that works
- the training data used in essentially all large language models includes a significant amount of copyrighted or otherwise non-permissive licensing in the first place
- other work using the self-instruct method, e.g. the original here: https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct released the data and model as apache-2

I am purposingly leaving this license ambiguous (other than the fact you must comply with the Meta original license for llama-2) because I am not a lawyer and refuse to attempt to interpret all of the terms accordingly.

Your best bet is probably to avoid using this commercially due to the OpenAI API usage.

Either way, by using this model, you agree to completely indemnify me.
