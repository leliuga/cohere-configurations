# Overview
Fine-tuned [Llama-2 7B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-fp16) with an uncensored/unfiltered Wizard-Vicuna conversation dataset (originally from [ehartford/wizard_vicuna_70k_unfiltered](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ehartford/wizard_vicuna_70k_unfiltered)).
Used QLoRA for fine-tuning. Trained for one epoch on a 24GB GPU (NVIDIA A10G) instance, took ~19 hours to train.

The version here is the fp16 HuggingFace model.

## GGML & GPTQ versions
Thanks to [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke), he has created the GGML and GPTQ versions:

* https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/llama2_7b_chat_uncensored-GPTQ

# Prompt style
The model was trained with the following prompt style:
```
### HUMAN:
Hello

### RESPONSE:
Hi, how are you?

### HUMAN:
I'm fine.

### RESPONSE:
How can I help you?
...
```

# Training code
