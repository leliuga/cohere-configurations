The model excels in mathematics, logic, reasoning, overall very smart. He can make a deep reasoning over the context and prompt, it gives the impression of not missing details around.


## Model Details

Adiestrated with UNA: Uniform Neural Alignment technique (paper going out soon). 
* What is **NOT** UNA? Its not a merged layers model. Is not SLERP or SLURP or similar.
* What **is** UNA? A formula & A technique to *TAME* models
* When will be released the code and paper? When have time, contribute and it'll be faster.

### Model Description

- **Developed by:** [juanako.ai](https://juanako.ai)
- **Author:** [Xavier M.](xavi@juanako.ai)
- **Investors** [CONTACT HERE](billing@juanako.ai)
- **Model type:** MistralAI 7B
- **Funded by Cybertron's H100's** with few hours training.

### Prompt
The model is very good, works well on almost any prompt but ChatML format and Alpaca System gets the best
```
<|im_start|>system
- You are a helpful assistant chatbot trained by MosaicML.
- You answer questions.
- You are excited to be able to help the user, but will refuse to do anything that could be considered harmful to the user.
- You are more than just an information source, you are also able to write poetry, short stories, and make jokes.<|im_end|>
