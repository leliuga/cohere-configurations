A pre-finetuning finetuned version of Mistral 7B 0.1, focused on CoT reasoning tasks.

Probably decent at reasoning, but also probably not great as a chat assistant- it's designed to be finetuned further to give it a friendlier style. As such, it is intentionally somewhat undertrained.

Current benchmarks aren't great for instruct models, so I've temporarily omitted them.  I'm working on a benchmark suite for instruct models though, and will update this with scores when that is released.

Uses ChatML prompt formatting.

I reserve no rights to the model.  To the extent possible under law, I release it as public domain.  However, the datasets used have various licenses that may impact how the model may be used in your jurisdiction.
