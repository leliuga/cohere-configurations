# Defog SQLCoder
**Updated on Nov 14 to reflect benchmarks for SQLCoder-34B**

Defog's SQLCoder is a state-of-the-art LLM for converting natural language questions to SQL queries.

[Interactive Demo](https://defog.ai/sqlcoder-demo/) | [ü§ó HF Repo](https://huggingface.co/defog/sqlcoder-34b-alpha) | [‚ôæÔ∏è Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z4rmOEiFkxkMiecAWeTUlPl0OmKgfEu7?usp=sharing) | [üê¶ Twitter](https://twitter.com/defogdata)

## TL;DR
SQLCoder-34B is a 34B parameter model that outperforms `gpt-4` and `gpt-4-turbo` for natural language to SQL generation tasks on our [sql-eval](https://github.com/defog-ai/sql-eval) framework, and significantly outperforms all popular open-source models.

SQLCoder-34B is fine-tuned on a base CodeLlama model.

## License
The code in this repo (what little there is of it) is Apache-2 licensed. The model weights have a `CC BY-SA 4.0` license. The TL;DR is that you can use and modify the model for any purpose ‚Äì including commercial use. However, if you modify the weights (for example, by fine-tuning), you must open-source your modified weights under the same license terms.

## Training
Defog was trained on more than 20,000 human-curated questions. These questions were based on 10 different schemas. None of the schemas in the training data were included in our evaluation framework. 

You can read more about our [training approach](https://defog.ai/blog/open-sourcing-sqlcoder2-7b/) and [evaluation framework](https://defog.ai/blog/open-sourcing-sqleval/).

## Results by question category
We classified each generated question into one of 5 categories. The table displays the percentage of questions answered correctly by each model, broken down by category.

## Using SQLCoder
You can use SQLCoder via the `transformers` library by downloading our model weights from the Hugging Face repo. We have added sample code for [inference](./inference.py) on a [sample database schema](./metadata.sql). 
```bash
python inference.py -q "Question about the sample database goes here"

# Sample question:
# Do we get more revenue from customers in New York compared to customers in San Francisco? Give me the total revenue for each city, and the difference between the two.
```

You can also use a demo on our website [here](https://defog.ai/sqlcoder-demo)

## Hardware Requirements
SQLCoder-34B has been tested on a 4xA10 GPU with `float16` weights. You can also load an 8-bit and 4-bit quantized version of the model on consumer GPUs with 20GB or more of memory ‚Äì¬†like RTX 4090, RTX 3090, and Apple M2 Pro, M2 Max, or M2 Ultra Chips with 20GB or more of memory.

## Todo

- [x] Open-source the v1 model weights
- [x] Train the model on more data, with higher data variance
- [ ] Tune the model further with Reward Modelling and RLHF
- [ ] Pretrain a model from scratch that specializes in SQL analysis
