## [January 2024] New Model Release: Arithmo2-Mistral-7B

**Arithmo2-Mistral-7B** model improves initially released Arithmo-Mistral-7B model on both GSM8K and MATH benchmarks. Specifically, there is **absolute** improvement of:
- +1.7% on GSM8K
- +3.0% on GSM8K PoT
- +1.9% on MATH

<b>Note</b>: <span style="color:red"><b>It is recommended to use Arithmo2-Mistral-7B model</b></span>. Here is the [merged model](https://huggingface.co/upaya07/Arithmo2-Mistral-7B) and corresponding [LoRA Adapter](https://huggingface.co/upaya07/Arithmo2-Mistral-7B-adapter).

**P.S.:** Please reach out to [Ashvini Jindal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashvini-jindal-26653262/) if you would be interested in supporting compute need. We are looking for small-scale support so we'd appreciate any kind of help! :)

## Model Details

Arithmo-Mistral-7B is trained to reason and answer mathematical problems and is also capable of writing a Python program that upon execution prints answer to the question. We used [Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) as a base model and used **QLoRA to fine-tune it on a single RTX 4090 GPU**.

### Model Description

- **Project GitHub Page:** https://github.com/akjindal53244/Arithmo-Mistral-7B
- **Developed by:** [Ashvini Kumar Jindal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashvini-jindal-26653262/), [Ankur Parikh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankurnlpexpert/)
- **Funded by:** self-work
- **Model type:** fine-tuned
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English
- **Finetuned from model:** mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1

## Results

Arithmo-Mistral-7B outperforms existing 7B and 13B state-of-the-art Mathematical Reasoning models. Refer to [Comparing Arithmo-Mistral-7B with other LLM models](https://github.com/akjindal53244/Arithmo-Mistral-7B/tree/master#comparing-arithmo-mistral-7b-with-other-llm-models) section for more details.

- **Zero-Shot CoT**: On providing a question as prompt, model generates reasoning steps to solve the question along with answer. We check if answer matches with ground-truth.
- **Zero-Shot PoT**: We prompt the model to generate a Python program for the given question. During inference, we execute the Python program generated by the model and check if the program output matches with ground-truth answer.


## Installation

```
pip install transformers >=4.34.0
pip install accelerate
pip install sentencepiece
pip install protobuf

# If you are GPU poor like me
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# If you have a GPU.
pip install --pre torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu118
pip install scipy
pip install bitsandbytes
```


## How to query the model

```
# Set `run_model_on_gpu` to `False` if you are running on CPU. Model will generate reasoning steps with answer for your question. If you want to generate Python program, uncomment line-69 that adds a Python prompt.
# This script automatically does formatting for you, so you just need to type question (eg: `What is 2+2?`) without any prefix like `Question:`, etc.**

$ python query_model.py
```
**Note:** Above script automatically does formatting for you, so you just need to type question (eg: `What is 2+2?`) without any prefix like `Question:`, etc. Checkout [query_model.py](https://github.com/akjindal53244/Arithmo-Mistral-7B/blob/master/query_model.py) for more details. <br><br>

##### Sample Input:
```
Question: There are total 10 children. I have to give 1 apple to first child, 2 apples to second child, 3 apples to third child, and so on. How many apples do I need?
```
##### Model Output:
```
Answer: The total number of apples needed is the sum of the first 10 positive integers.
This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[S = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n),\]
where $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.
In this case, $n = 10$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_n = 10$.
Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[S = \frac{10}{2}(1 + 10) = 5(11) = \boxed{55}.\]
The answer is: 55
```

Arithmo-Mistral-7B is trained with the following format:
#### CoT Format (generate reasoning steps with answer):
```
Question: <question>

Answer:
```

#### PoT Format (generate a python program):
```
Question: <question> <python_prompt>

Answer:
```
It will perform best if queried in this way with your own script.
