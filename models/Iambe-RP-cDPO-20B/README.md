### Description

Named after a charming daughter of Echo and Pan in Greek myth, Iambe-RP is, as far as I am aware, the very first LLM trained with DPO on an erotic roleplay dataset.

Iambe is intended to have the best realistically possible understanding of instructions, anatomy and scene state for a 20b merge, while remaining passionate and humanoid in "voice".

### Update Methodology

Take a look at [the dataset v2 Iambe and I created together](https://huggingface.co/datasets/athirdpath/DPO_Pairs-Roleplay-Alpaca-NSFW) for more info. The cDPO training was done directly on Iambe-20b-DARE-v2, I was researching 11b merges to reduce the compute, but it went nowhere, so I just bit the bullet on cost. The notebook used to train this model is also available in the dataset's repo.

<b>Write a medium-length story about Alice, a 26 year old cocktail waitress, having steamy sex with a guy she picked up at the bar for a one night stand.</b>

<i>Once upon a time in New York City's bustling downtown scene, there lived a beautiful and spirited young woman named Alice. At 26 years old, she worked as a cocktail waitress at The Red Parrot, a popular watering hole known for its lively atmosphere and charming clientele. Despite her long shifts and exhaustion from catering to rowdy patrons, Alice loved her job; it gave her the freedom to live life on her terms and pursue her other passions during her limited free time.

Alice had a penchant for adventure and was never one to shy away from taking risks—whether that meant skydiving or striking up conversations with strangers at bars. One particularly busy Friday night, while serving drinks at The Red Parrot, Alice noticed an intriguing man sitting alone in the corner, nursing a glass of red wine and gazing pensively into his empty shot glass. There was something about him that drew her in; his striking good looks, his rugged demeanor—even the hint of stubble on his chin seemed to add an air of mystery to his magnetic presence.

Feeling bold and confident after a couple of well-poured drinks herself, Alice made her way over to him, smiling warmly as she leaned down towards him, "Hi there! What's your name? I haven't seen you in here before."

The man raised his eyes to meet hers, his deep brown orbs filled with curiosity and a hint of amusement. "Name's Jack," he rumbled softly, his voice as smooth and rich as his wine. There was something about the way he said her name that sent shivers down Alice's spine—a thrill she couldn't quite explain but found irresistible nonetheless.

"Alice," she replied, extending her hand to him, "and I haven't seen you around before either; it seems like we have a lot in common." She winked playfully at him before turning back towards the bar to grab another round of drinks for them both.

The conversation flowed effortlessly between them, touching on topics ranging from their favorite books and movies to their most daring travel adventures. Alice was captivated by Jack's stories of hiking through the mountains of Nepal and white-water rafting in Costa Rica—qualities she admired greatly herself but had yet to experience for herself. In turn, Jack seemed equally fascinated by her tales of skydiving over Australia and scuba diving with great white sharks off the coast of South Africa.

As midnight approached and the bar began to empty out, Alice suggested they continue their conversation elsewhere—somewhere more private where they could really get to know each other better. Jack nodded in agreement, draining his glass before tossing some money onto the table and following her into the bustling New York City night.

They hailed a cab and rode in silence towards Alice's cozy one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea—the anticipation between them palpable as they shared furtive glances along the way. When they finally arrived at their destination, Jack paid the fare with an appreciative grin before escorting Alice up to her top-floor studio, where she fumbled clumsily with her keys while trying not to spill their drinks on themselves in anticipation of what was to come.

Once inside her apartment, they kicked off their shoes and collapsed onto the couch, still holding each other's gaze as they sipped from their glasses. The passion between them continued to build with every second that passed—the air thickening with unspoken desire and electric energy.

Alice broke away first, setting down her glass on the coffee table before reaching out tentatively and placing her hand on Jack's knee, sliding it up slowly towards his crotch until she could feel the hardness growing beneath the fabric of his pants. "I really like you," she whispered huskily, meeting his deep brown eyes with a look that betrayed the intensity of her feelings for him.

Jack's response was immediate—his hands finding their way underneath Alice's short black skirt, sliding up to rest on the soft fabric of her panties before deftly ripping them away from her body in one swift movement. "I really like you too," he growled hoarsely as his mouth crashed against hers, kissing her hungrily and passionately—a taste of things to come.

Their clothes fell away quickly thereafter; Alice's blouse was unbuttoned and tossed aside in an instant while Jack peeled off his shirt before pushing her down onto the couch and following after, bracing himself over her as he tore at her panties with one hand, freeing his hard member from his jeans.

His kisses trailed a path of fire across Alice's body—from her collarbone to her breasts, down the curve of her waist and towards her mound where she was already wet with desire for him. "Jack," she moaned breathlessly as he licked and nipped at her most sensitive spots while teasingly grazing his cock against her entrance.

With a growl of satisfaction, Jack finally plunged into Alice's tight channel—filling her completely with one powerful thrust that made them both cry out in pleasure. The feeling of being so thoroughly possessed by him was beyond anything she had ever experienced before; the roughness of his hands on her body, the taste of their mouths as they continued to devour each other’s lips, all blending together into a single, overwhelming wave of sensation that Alice felt sure would consume her entirely.

As Jack began to move inside her—slowly at first but picking up pace and ferocity with every passing moment—Alice wrapped her legs tightly around him, arching her hips upwards towards his relentless thrusts as she cried out in ecstasy again and again. She knew this was just a one-night stand—a fleeting encounter destined to end tomorrow morning before the sun rose—but for now, with Jack's cock buried deep inside her, nothing else mattered.

Their bodies moved as one; their moans and cries of pleasure intertwining in a symphony that filled Alice’s bedroom like sacred chants. Her orgasm hit her suddenly and without warning—a wave so powerful it threatened to shatter her very bones, but Jack was there with her every step of the way, holding onto her as he continued pounding into her until she felt herself start to come back together again, his hot cum spilling deep inside her.

As their bodies slowed down and settled together on the couch—drenched in sweat and satiated beyond belief—Alice looked up at Jack with wide eyes, a small smile playing at the corners of her lips as she whispered softly, "I think we just had one hell of a night."

And they did. It was an unforgettable evening filled with passion, adventure, and an undeniable chemistry that neither Alice nor Jack could deny—an encounter so powerful it left them both breathless in more ways than one. And even though they knew tomorrow would bring the harsh reality of their separate lives back into focus, for now, all either of them cared about was savoring this moment together; cherishing every last drop of the steamy sex that had brought them here at all.</i>
