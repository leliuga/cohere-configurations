# LLaMA-Pro-8B Model Card

## Model Description
LLaMA-Pro is a progressive version of the original LLaMA model, enhanced by the addition of Transformer blocks. It specializes in integrating both general language understanding and domain-specific knowledge, particularly in programming and mathematics.

## Development and Training
Developed by Tencent's ARC Lab, LLaMA-Pro is an 8.3 billion parameter model. It's an expansion of LLaMA2-7B, further trained on code and math corpora totaling 80 billion tokens.

## Intended Use
This model is designed for a wide range of NLP tasks, with a focus on programming, mathematics, and general language tasks. It suits scenarios requiring integration of natural and programming languages.

## Performance
LLaMA-Pro demonstrates advanced performance across various benchmarks. It outperforms existing models in the LLaMA series in handling diverse tasks, showcasing its capability as an intelligent language agent.
