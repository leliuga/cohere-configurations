## Dataset Details

### Used Datasets

- Orca-style dataset
- No other data was used except for the dataset mentioned above

### Prompt Template
```
### System:
{System}

### User:
{User}

### Assistant:
{Assistant}
```

## Usage

- Tested on A100 80GB
- Our model can handle up to 10k+ input tokens, thanks to the `rope_scaling` option

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, TextStreamer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("upstage/llama-65b-instruct")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "upstage/llama-65b-instruct",
    device_map="auto",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    load_in_8bit=True,
    rope_scaling={"type": "dynamic", "factor": 2} # allows handling of longer inputs
)

prompt = "### User:\nThomas is healthy, but he has to go to the hospital. What could be the reasons?\n\n### Assistant:\n"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
del inputs["token_type_ids"]
streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer, skip_prompt=True, skip_special_tokens=True)

output = model.generate(**inputs, streamer=streamer, use_cache=True, max_new_tokens=float('inf'))
output_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```

## Hardware and Software

* **Hardware**: We utilized an A100x8 * 4 for training our model
* **Training Factors**: We fine-tuned this model using a combination of the [DeepSpeed library](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) and the [HuggingFace Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer)

## Evaluation Results

### Overview
- We conducted a performance evaluation based on the tasks being evaluated on the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard).
We evaluated our model on four benchmark datasets, which include `ARC-Challenge`, `HellaSwag`, `MMLU`, and `TruthfulQA`.
We used the [lm-evaluation-harness repository](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), specifically commit [b281b0921b636bc36ad05c0b0b0763bd6dd43463](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/b281b0921b636bc36ad05c0b0b0763bd6dd43463)
- We used [MT-bench](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge), a set of challenging multi-turn open-ended questions, to evaluate the models

## Ethical Issues

### Ethical Considerations
- There were no ethical issues involved, as we did not include the benchmark test set or the training set in the model's training process
