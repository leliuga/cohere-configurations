# OpenOrca-Platypus2-13B

OpenOrca-Platypus2-13B is a merge of [`garage-bAInd/Platypus2-13B`](https://huggingface.co/garage-bAInd/Platypus2-13B) and [`Open-Orca/OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B`](https://huggingface.co/Open-Orca/OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B).

This model is more than the sum of its parts! We are happy to be teaming up with the [Platypus](https://platypus-llm.github.io/) team to bring you a new model which once again tops the leaderboards!

Want to visualize our full (pre-filtering) dataset? Check out our [Nomic Atlas Map](https://atlas.nomic.ai/map/c1b88b47-2d9b-47e0-9002-b80766792582/2560fd25-52fe-42f1-a58f-ff5eccc890d2).

We are in-process with training more models, so keep a look out on our org for releases coming soon with exciting partners.

We will also give sneak-peak announcements on our Discord, which you can find here:

# Evaluation

## HuggingFace Leaderboard Performance

![HF Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/Open-Orca/OpenOrca-Platypus2-13B/resolve/main/Images/OrcaPlatypus13BHFLeaderboard.webp)


| Metric | Value |
|-----------------------|-------|
| MMLU (5-shot)         | 59.5  |
| ARC (25-shot)         | 62.88 |
| HellaSwag (10-shot)   | 83.19 |
| TruthfulQA (0-shot)   | 52.69 |
| Avg.                  | 64.56 |

We use [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) to run the benchmark tests above, using the same version as the HuggingFace LLM Leaderboard.

Please see below for detailed instructions on reproducing benchmark results.


## AGIEval Performance

We compare our results to our base Preview2 model (using LM Evaluation Harness).

We find **112%** of the base model's performance on AGI Eval, averaging **0.463**.
A large part of this boost is the substantial improvement to LSAT Logical Reasoning performance.

## BigBench-Hard Performance

We compare our results to our base Preview2 model (using LM Evaluation Harness).

We find **105%** of the base model's performance on BigBench-Hard, averaging **0.442**.

# Training

## Training Datasets

`garage-bAInd/Platypus2-13B` trained using STEM and logic based dataset [`garage-bAInd/Open-Platypus`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/garage-bAInd/Open-Platypus).

Please see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07317) and [project webpage](https://platypus-llm.github.io) for additional information.

`Open-Orca/OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B` trained using a refined subset of most of the GPT-4 data from the [OpenOrca dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca).


## Training Procedure

`Open-Orca/Platypus2-13B` was instruction fine-tuned using LoRA on 1x A100-80GB.
For training details and inference instructions please see the [Platypus](https://github.com/arielnlee/Platypus) GitHub repo.

```


## Limitations and bias

Llama 2 and fine-tuned variants are a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2 and any fine-tuned varient's potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2 variants, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.
