# Model Card for Meditron-7B-v1.0
Meditron is a suite of open-source medical Large Language Models (LLMs).
Meditron-7B is a 7 billion parameters model adapted to the medical domain from Llama-2-7B through continued pretraining on a comprehensively curated medical corpus, including selected PubMed articles, abstracts, a [new dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/epfl-llm/guidelines) of internationally-recognized medical guidelines, and general domain data from [RedPajama-v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T).
Meditron-7B, finetuned on relevant training data, outperforms Llama-2-7B and PMC-Llama on multiple medical reasoning tasks.

  <summary><strong>Advisory Notice</strong></summary>

  <blockquote style="padding: 10px; margin: 0 0 10px; border-left: 5px solid #ddd;">
    While Meditron is designed to encode medical knowledge from sources of high-quality evidence, it is not yet adapted to deliver this knowledge appropriately, safely, or within professional actionable constraints. 
  We recommend against deploying Meditron in medical applications without extensive use-case alignment, as well as additional testing, specifically including randomized controlled trials in real-world practice settings.

## Uses

Meditron-7B is being made available for further testing and assessment as an AI assistant to enhance clinical decision-making and enhance access to an LLM for healthcare use. Potential use cases may include but are not limited to:
-  Medical exam question answering
-  Supporting differential diagnosis
-  Disease information (symptoms, cause, treatment) query
-  General health information query

### Direct Use

It is possible to use this model to generate text, which is useful for experimentation and understanding its capabilities. 
It should not be used directly for production or work that may impact people.

### Downstream Use
Meditron-70B and Meditron-7B are both foundation models without finetuning or instruction-tuning. They can be finetuned, instruction-tuned, or RLHF-tuned for specific downstream tasks and applications.
There are two ways we have used this model for downstream question-answering tasks.
1. We apply in-context learning with k demonstrations (3 or 5 in our paper) added to the prompt.
2. We finetuned the models for downstream question-answering tasks using specific training sets.

We encourage and look forward to the adaption of the base model for more diverse applications.

If you want a more interactive way to prompt the model, we recommend using a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference engine with a UI that supports chat and text generation.

You can check out our deployment [guide](https://github.com/epfLLM/meditron/blob/main/deployment/README.md), where we used [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) with [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). We collected generations for our qualitative analysis through an interactive UI platform, [BetterChatGPT](https://github.com/ztjhz/BetterChatGPT). Here is the prompt format we used as an example:

### Out-of-Scope Use

We do not recommend using this model for natural language generation in a production environment, finetuned or otherwise.

## Truthfulness, Helpfulness, Risk, and Bias

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->

We did an initial assessment of Meditron models' **Truthfulness** against baseline models and consumer-level medical models. 
We use TruthfulQA (multiple choice) as the main evaluation benchmark.
We only focus on the categories that are relevant to the medical domain, including Health, Nutrition, Psychology, and Science.
For 7B models, we perform one-shot evaluations for consistent answer generation.
For 70B models, the evaluations are under the zero-shot setting.
Below, we report the detailed truthfulness performance of each category.

For a more detailed performance analysis, please see our paper. 

Significant research is still required to fully explore potential bias, fairness, and safety issues with this language model. 
Please recognize that our evaluation on Meditron-7B's helpfulness, risk, and bias are highly limited. 
Thus, as we noted in the safety notice, we strongly against any deployment in medical applications without further alignment process and rigorous evaluation!

### Recommendations

**IMPORTANT!**
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases, and limitations of the model.
While this model is capable of generating natural language text, we have only begun to explore this capability and its limitations. 
Understanding these limitations is especially important in a domain like medicine. 
Therefore, we strongly recommend against using this model in production for natural language generation or for professional purposes related to health and medicine.

## Training Details

### Training Data
Meditronâ€™s domain-adaptive pre-training corpus GAP-Replay  combines 48.1B tokens from four corpora:
- [**Clinical  Guidelines**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/epfl-llm/guidelines): a new dataset of 46K internationally-recognized clinical practice guidelines from various healthcare-related sources, including hospitals and international organizations.
- **Medical Paper Abstracts**: 16.1M abstracts extracted from closed-access PubMed and PubMed Central papers.
- **Medical Papers**: full-text articles extracted from 5M publicly available PubMed and PubMed Central papers.
- **Replay Data**: 400M tokens of general domain pretraining data sampled from [RedPajama-v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T)

#### Data Preprocessing

Please see the detailed preprocessing procedure in our paper. 

### Training Procedure 

We used the [Megatron-LLM](https://github.com/epfLLM/Megatron-LLM) distributed training library, a derivative of Nvidia's Megatron LM project, to optimize training efficiency. 
Hardware consists of 1 node of 8x NVIDIA A100 (80GB) SXM GPUs connected by NVLink and NVSwitch with a single Nvidia ConnectX-6 DX network card and equipped with 2 x AMD EPYC 7543 32-Core Processors and 512 GB of RAM. 

Our three way parallelism scheme uses:
 - Data Parallelism (DP -- different GPUs process different subsets of the batches) of 2,
 - Pipeline Parallelism (PP -- different GPUs process different layers) of 4,
 - Tensor Parallelism (TP -- different GPUs process different subtensors for matrix multiplication) of 1.

## Environmental Impact

<!-- Total emissions (in grams of CO2eq) and additional considerations, such as electricity usage, go here. Edit the suggested text below accordingly -->

- **Hardware Type:** 8 x NVIDIA A100 (80GB) SXM
- **Total GPU hours:** 588.8
- **Hardware Provider:** EPFL Research Computing Platform
- **Compute Region:** Switzerland
- **Carbon Emitted:** Switzerland has a carbon efficiency of 0.016 kgCO2/kWh (https://www.carbonfootprint.com/docs/2018_8_electricity_factors_august_2018_-_online_sources.pdf). 73.6 hours of 8 A100s means 588.8 hours at a TDP of 400W. Assuming a Power Usage effectiveness of 1.5, total emissions are estimated to be: 
    
   (400W / 1000W/kWh / GPU * 0.016 kgCO2/kWh * 73.6 h * 8 GPU) * 1.8 PUE = 6.8 kgCO2.
