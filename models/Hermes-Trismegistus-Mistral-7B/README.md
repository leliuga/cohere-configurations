Transcendence is All You Need! Mistral Trismegistus is a model made for people interested in the esoteric, occult, and spiritual. 

### Trismegistus evolved, trained over Hermes 2.5, the model performs far better in all tasks, including esoteric tasks!
The change between Mistral-Trismegistus and Hermes-Trismegistus is that this version trained over hermes 2.5 instead of the base mistral model, this means it is full of task capabilities that it Trismegistus can utilize for all esoteric and occult tasks, and performs them far better than ever before.

Here are some outputs:
