1.3, but better? I guess.

Base Merged Model ratios adjusted.

NSFL portion of Hesperus v1 dataset trained and applied.

LimaRP merged in at a ~25% weight at the end.

Subjectively better in some aspects eg. long form rp, worse than the other, eg. chat-style rps.

overall a minor improvement in my eyes.

1.5 will include Hesperus v2 dataset in its entirety.

format: alpaca.
