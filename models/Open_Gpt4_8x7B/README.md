This model is a TIES merger of notux-8x7b-v1 and UNAversal-8x7B-v1beta with MixtralOrochi8x7B being the Base model.

I was very impressed with MixtralOrochi8x7B performance and multifaceted usecases as it is already a merger of many usefull Mixtral models such as Mixtral instruct, 

Noromaid-v0.1-mixtral, openbuddy-mixtral and possibly other models that were not named. My goal was to expand the models capabilities and make it even more useful of a model, maybe even competitive with closed source models like Gpt-4. But for that more testing is required. I hope the community can help me determine if its deserving of its name. ðŸ˜Š
