Thanks to [Charles Goddard](https://huggingface.co/chargoddard) for the recipe.

The idea here is to "move" Iambe from being based on vanilla L2 to being based on sequelbox/DynamicFactor instead.

Because task_arithmetic uses the raw deltas, this should be similar to if the SFT had been done over DynamicFactor.

## Recipe

merge_method: task_arithmetic

base_model: athirdpath/BigLlama-20b-v1.1      # Base model you want to "move out" from

models:

  - model: athirdpath/Iambe-20b-DARE-v2       # SFTd model you want to transfer

  - model: athirdpath/DoubleFactor-20b      # Base model you want to "move in" to

parameters:

  - weight: 1.0
