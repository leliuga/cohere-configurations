Winter Goddess - A 70B L2 Model for General use, or for Roleplay.

I wanted a Smart Model that is Capable of following Instructions, while being able to (e)RP effectively. Sort of like 1.3, but better.

I merged some models as a base, and had tuned on top of it afterwards.

I personally think this mogs Euryale 1.3, but ymmv.
