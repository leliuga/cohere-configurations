# OpenOrca - LlongOrca - 7B - 16k

We have used our own [OpenOrca dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca) to fine-tune on top of [LLongMA-2-7b-16k](https://huggingface.co/conceptofmind/LLongMA-2-7b-16k). 
This dataset is our attempt to reproduce the dataset generated for Microsoft Research's [Orca Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707).
We use [OpenChat](https://huggingface.co/openchat) packing, trained with [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl).

This release is trained on a curated filtered subset of most of our GPT-4 augmented data.
It is the same subset of our data as was used in our [OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B model](https://huggingface.co/Open-Orca/OpenOrcaxOpenChat-Preview2-13B).

This release reveals that stacking our training on an existing long context fine-tuned model yields significant improvements to model performance.
We measured this with BigBench-Hard and AGIEval results, finding **~134%** of the base Llongma2-16k model's performance on average.

We have run extensive evaluations internally and expect this model to place number 4 on the HuggingFaceH4 Open LLM Leaderboard for 7B models, but with >99% performance of the first place and **place number 1** for longer context 7B models.

We did this training as part of testing integration of OpenChat's [MultiPack algorithm](https://github.com/imoneoi/multipack_sampler) into the Axolotl trainer.
MultiPack achieves 99.85% bin-packing efficiency on our dataset.
This has significantly reduced training time, with efficiency improvement of 3-10X over traditional methods.

Many thanks to @EnricoShippole, @theemozilla, and @kaiokendev1 for the fine work on creating the LlongMA-2-7b-16k model this was trained on top of!

We are in-process with training more models, so keep a look out on our org for releases coming soon with exciting partners.

We will also give sneak-peak announcements on our Discord, which you can find here:

# Prompt Template

We used [OpenAI's Chat Markup Language (ChatML)](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/chatml.md) format, with `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` tokens added to support this.

## Example Prompt Exchange

```
<|im_start|>system
You are LlongOrca, a large language model trained by Alignment Lab AI. Write out your reasoning step-by-step to be sure you get the right answers!
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
How are you<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant

```


# Evaluation

We have evaluated using the methodology and tools for the HuggingFace Leaderboard, and find that we have significantly improved upon the base long context model.
As well, we should place #4 among all 7B models (and #1 for a model with long context) at release time!

## AGIEval Performance

We present our performance on AGI Eval in comparison to base Llama2-7B and to [Llongma2-7b-16k](https://huggingface.co/conceptofmind/LLongMA-2-7b-16k), which we trained on top of.
This demonstrates the benefits of stacking OpenOrca dataset training on existing models.
Most notably, there is a very dramatic improvement of nearly 3X in the English writing performance.

## BigBench-Hard Performance

We present our performance on BigBench-Hard in comparison to base Llama2-7B and to [Llongma2-7b-16k](https://huggingface.co/conceptofmind/LLongMA-2-7b-16k), which we trained on top of.
This demonstrates the benefits of stacking OpenOrca dataset training on existing models.

## HuggingFaceH4 Open LLM Leaderboard Performance

We have run our own tests using parameters matching the [HuggingFaceH4 Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) evals.

We place #4 for all 7B models at release time, and #1 for long context models.

# Dataset

We used a curated, filtered selection of most of the GPT-4 augmented data from our OpenOrca dataset, which aims to reproduce the Orca Research Paper dataset.
Further details of our curation practices will be forthcoming with our full model releases.


# Training

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl/main/image/axolotl-badge-web.png" alt="Built with Axolotl"/>](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl)

We trained with 8x A6000-48GB (first-gen) GPUs for 37 hours, completing 4 epochs of full fine tuning on our dataset in one training run.
Commodity cost was ~$200.
Axolotl training parameters can be found in [configs/oo7b.yml](https://huggingface.co/Open-Orca/LlongOrca-7B-16k/blob/main/configs/oo-7b.yml).
We used the `packing-attn` branch of Axolotl during training.
