***Updated and Better version: https://huggingface.co/Sao10K/Euryale-1.3-L2-70B***


An experimental merging of Several Models using 3 merging methods. Ties-Merge, BlockMerge_Gradient [& SLERP Variant] as well as SLERP.
5 Models included Inside, 2 LORAs.

***Early release because I'll be busy from the next month onwards. Enlistment. Incomplete but workable, see below.***

SISTER MODEL HERE: [Euryale-Inverted-L2-70B](https://huggingface.co/Sao10K/Euryale-Inverted-L2-70B)

*Same concept as Stheno & Stheno Inverted, at different densities, weights and gradients.*

*Illustration for final gradient merge cannot be shown, each of the tensors had a different ratio applied to it.*

<br>Test Checklist:
<br>Censorship - NSFW Okay, NSFL Minor Censorship (A Small Jailbreak works fine.)
<br>Writing - Pretty Good Prose and Writing Quality
<br>NSFW - Yes ***SEE BELOW: JB EXAMPLE***
<br>IQ Level - Pretty Smart, Able to follow complex Instructions. Not the best at Coding / Math though, best if question is specific.
<br>Formatting - Able to follow markdown, and codeblock statuses fine.

*Inverted has no censorship problems but is a little dumber. Read her card to find out more.*

<br>Most formats could work, but my tests have all been done in Alpaca format and it works well.

### Instruction:
Your instruction or question here.
For roleplay purposes, I suggest the following - Write <CHAR NAME>'s next reply in a chat between <YOUR NAME> and <CHAR NAME>. Write a single reply only.

### Response:
```


<br>My 7th Attempt. Incomplete so far, early release.
<br>Timeline Goals:
<br> Apply COT to model to smarten her up.
<br> Apply the RP LoRA I'm working on to model.
<br> Further tinker and test for potential better combinations.


Once Again, thanks to [Chargoddard](https://huggingface.co/chargoddard) and [Gryphe](https://huggingface.co/Gryphe) for their scripts, and @Vali for modifying some of the scripts provided to implement SLERP on a Cloud GPU Service.
Thanks to @gradientputri for partially sponsoring half of the compute costs for my Runpod usage. (>$200 lol)
Thanks to the original model creators too!
