Open_Gpt4_v0.2

This is the un-quantized fp16 version for training and merging. If you want the quantized version for inference please refer to the repo bellow:

This model is a TIES merger of Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1  and bagel-dpo-8x7b-v0.2 with MixtralOrochi8x7B being the Base model.



I was very impressed with MixtralOrochi8x7B performance and multifaceted usecases as it is already a merger of many usefull Mixtral models such as Mixtral instruct, 
Noromaid-v0.1-mixtral, openbuddy-mixtral and possibly other models that were not named. My goal was to expand the models capabilities and make it even more useful of a model, maybe even competitive with closed source models like Gpt-4. But for that more testing is required. I hope the community can help me determine if its deserving of its name. ðŸ˜Š

This is the second iteration of this model, using better models in the merger to improve performance (hopefully).
