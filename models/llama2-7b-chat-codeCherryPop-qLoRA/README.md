### Overview:
  description:
    
    This is a llama2 7B HF chat model fine-tuned on 122k code instructions. In my early experiments it seems to be doing very well.
  
  additional_info:
    
    It's a bottom of the barrel model ðŸ˜‚ but after quantization it can be
    valuable for sure. It definitely proves that a 7B can be useful for boilerplate
    code stuff though.

### Plans:
  next_steps: "I've a few things in mind and after that this will be more valuable."
  
  tasks:
  
    - name: "I'll quantize these"
      timeline: "Possibly tonight or tomorrow in the day"
      result: "Then it can be run locally with 4G ram."
    - name: "I've used alpaca style instruction tuning"
      improvement: |
        I'll switch to llama2 style [INST]<<SYS>> style and see if
        it improves anything.
    - name: "HumanEval report and checking for any training data leaks"
    - attempt: "I'll try 8k context via RoPE enhancement"
      hypothesis: "Let's see if that degrades performance or not."
  commercial_use: |
    So far I think this can be used commercially but this is a adapter on Meta's llama2 with
    some gating issues so that is there.
