# Starling-LM-7B-alpha

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->

- **Developed by:** Banghua Zhu * , Evan Frick * , Tianhao Wu * , Hanlin Zhu and Jiantao Jiao.
- **Model type:** Language Model finetuned with RLHF / RLAIF
- **License:** Non commercial license
- **Finetuned from model:** [Openchat 3.5](https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat_3.5) (based on [Mistral-7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1))
 


We introduce Starling-7B, an open large language model (LLM) trained by Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). The model harnesses the power of our new GPT-4 labeled ranking dataset, [berkeley-nest/Nectar](https://huggingface.co/datasets/berkeley-nest/Nectar), and our new reward training and policy tuning pipeline. Starling-7B-alpha scores 8.09 in MT Bench with GPT-4 as a judge, outperforming every model to date on MT-Bench except for OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo. We release the ranking dataset [Nectar](https://huggingface.co/datasets/berkeley-nest/Nectar), the reward model [Starling-RM-7B-alpha](https://huggingface.co/berkeley-nest/Starling-RM-7B-alpha) and the language model [Starling-LM-7B-alpha](https://huggingface.co/berkeley-nest/Starling-LM-7B-alpha) on HuggingFace, and an online demo in LMSYS [Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org). Stay tuned for our forthcoming code and paper, which will provide more details on the whole process.

Starling-LM-7B-alpha is a language model trained from [Openchat 3.5](https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat_3.5) with reward model [berkeley-nest/Starling-RM-7B-alpha](https://huggingface.co/berkeley-nest/Starling-RM-7B-alpha) and policy optimization method [advantage-induced policy alignment (APA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02231). The evaluation results are listed below.

## Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

**Important: Please use the exact chat template provided below for the model. Otherwise there will be a degrade in the performance. The model output can be verbose in rare cases. Please consider setting temperature = 0 to make this happen less.**

Our model follows the exact chat template and usage as [Openchat 3.5](https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat_3.5). Please refer to their model card for more details.
In addition, our model is hosted on LMSYS [Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org) for free test.

The conversation template is the same as Openchat 3.5:
```
import transformers
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("openchat/openchat_3.5")

# Single-turn
tokens = tokenizer("GPT4 Correct User: Hello<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant:").input_ids
assert tokens == [1, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 22557, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747]

# Multi-turn
tokens = tokenizer("GPT4 Correct User: Hello<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant: Hi<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct User: How are you today?<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant:").input_ids
assert tokens == [1, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 22557, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 15359, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 1602, 460, 368, 3154, 28804, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747]

# Coding Mode
tokens = tokenizer("Code User: Implement quicksort using C++<|end_of_turn|>Code Assistant:").input_ids
assert tokens == [1, 7596, 1247, 28747, 26256, 2936, 7653, 1413, 334, 1680, 32000, 7596, 21631, 28747]
```

    )
    response_ids = outputs[0]
    response_text = tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response_text

# Single-turn conversation
prompt = "Hello, how are you?"
single_turn_prompt = f"GPT4 Correct User: {prompt}<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant:"
response_text = generate_response(single_turn_prompt)
print("Response:", response_text)

## Multi-turn conversation
prompt = "Hello"
follow_up_question =  "How are you today?"
response = ""
multi_turn_prompt = f"GPT4 Correct User: {prompt}<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant: {response}<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct User: {follow_up_question}<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant:"
response_text = generate_response(multi_turn_prompt)
print("Multi-turn conversation response:", response_text)

### Coding conversation
prompt = "Implement quicksort using C++"

response = generate_response(coding_prompt)
print("Coding conversation response:", response)
