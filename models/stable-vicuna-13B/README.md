# StableVicuna-13B

## Model Description

StableVicuna-13B is a [Vicuna-13B v0](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-13b-delta-v0) model fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on various conversational and instructional datasets.

### Apply Delta Weights

StableVicuna-13B cannot be used from the `CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta` weights alone. To obtain the correct model, one must add back the difference between LLaMA 13B and `CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta` weights. We provide the [`apply_delta.py`](https://huggingface.co/CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta/raw/main/apply_delta.py) script to automate the conversion, which you can run as:

```sh
python3 apply_delta.py --base /path/to/model_weights/llama-13b --target stable-vicuna-13b --delta CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta
```


## Usage

Once the delta weights are applied, get started chatting with the model by using the [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers) library. Following a suggestion from Vicuna Team with Vicuna v0 you should install transformers with this version:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers@c612628045822f909020f7eb6784c79700813eda
```

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("path/to/stable-vicuna-13b-applied")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path/to/stable-vicuna-13b-applied")
model.half().cuda()

prompt = """\
### Human: Write a Python script for text classification using Transformers and PyTorch
### Assistant:\
"""

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt').to('cuda')
tokens = model.generate(
 **inputs,
 max_new_tokens=256,
 do_sample=True,
 temperature=1.0,
 top_p=1.0,
)
print(tokenizer.decode(tokens[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Training

### Training Dataset

StableVicuna-13B is fine-tuned on a mix of three datasets. [OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset (OASST1)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1), a human-generated, human-annotated assistant-style conversation corpus consisting of 161,443 messages distributed across 66,497 conversation trees, in 35 different languages;
[GPT4All Prompt Generations](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nomic-ai/gpt4all_prompt_generations), a dataset of 400k prompts and responses generated by GPT-4; and [Alpaca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca),  a dataset of 52,000 instructions and demonstrations generated by OpenAI's text-davinci-003 engine.

The reward model used during RLHF was also trained on [OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset (OASST1)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1) along with two other datasets: [Anthropic HH-RLHF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf), a dataset of preferences about AI assistant helpfulness and harmlessness; and [Stanford Human Preferences Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/SHP) a dataset of 385K collective human preferences over responses to questions/instructions in 18 different subject areas, from cooking to legal advice.

### Training Procedure

`CarperAI/stable-vicuna-13b-delta` was trained using PPO as implemented in [`trlX`](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/blob/main/trlx/trainer/accelerate_ppo_trainer.py) with the following configuration:

| min_length        | 48      |
| top_k             | 0.0     |
| top_p             | 1.0     |
| do_sample         | True    |
| temperature       | 1.0     |

## Use and Limitations

### Intended Use

This model is intended to be used for text generation with a focus on conversational tasks. Users may further fine-tune the model on their own data to improve the model's performance on their specific tasks in accordance with the non-commercial [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

### Limitations and bias

The base LLaMA model is trained on various data, some of which may contain offensive, harmful, and biased content that can lead to toxic behavior. See Section 5.1 of the LLaMA [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971). We have not performed any studies to determine how fine-tuning on the aforementioned datasets affect the model's behavior and toxicity. Do not treat chat responses from this model as a substitute for human judgment or as a source of truth. Please use responsibly.
