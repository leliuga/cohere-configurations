Changes concerning [Neuronovo/neuronovo-9B-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/Neuronovo/neuronovo-9B-v0.2):

1. **Training Dataset**: In addition to the [Intel/orca_dpo_pairs](Intel/orca_dpo_pairs) dataset, this version incorporates a [mlabonne/chatml_dpo_pairs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlabonne/chatml_dpo_pairs). The combined datasets enhance the model's capabilities in dialogues and interactive scenarios, further specializing it in natural language understanding and response generation.

2. **Tokenizer and Formatting**: The tokenizer now originates directly from the [Neuronovo/neuronovo-9B-v0.2](https://huggingface.co/Neuronovo/neuronovo-9B-v0.2) model.

3. **Training Configuration**: The training approach has shifted from using `max_steps=200` to `num_train_epochs=1`. This represents a change in the training strategy, focusing on epoch-based training rather than a fixed number of steps.

4. **Learning Rate**: The learning rate has been reduced to a smaller value of `5e-6`. This finer learning rate allows for more precise adjustments during the training process, potentially leading to better model performance.
